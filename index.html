<h2 id="abstract"><a class="toc-anchor" href="#abstract">§</a> Abstract</h2>
<p>The internet is broken. Existing communication channels are insecure and outdated. Because they rely on public identifiers — like email addresses, usernames, or phone numbers — anyone who knows your identifier can reach you, whether you invited them or not.</p>
<p>Worse, there’s no reliable way to verify the identity of either service providers or users. This leaves the door wide open to spam, phishing, fraud, and identity theft.</p>
<p>On the service side, each provider imposes its own fragmented registration process, often with complex password requirements or forced reliance on federated login systems, effectively handing control over to large third-party platforms.</p>
<p>Although the World Wide Web was originally built for openness and interoperability, dominant players have reshaped it into a closed, centralized system that most people and organizations now depend on. Privacy has become an afterthought, and personal data is routinely harvested, exploited, or leaked.</p>
<p>To rebuild a trustworthy internet, we need new communication channels - channels that are secure by design, based on mutual verification, and governed by decentralized trust.</p>
<p>Connecting to a service, proving who you are, or creating an account should be as simple and safe as presenting a verifiable credential.</p>
<p>A universal, open trust layer is essential for this vision to succeed.</p>
<p>That’s the purpose of <strong>Verifiable Trust</strong>.</p>

<p><em>This section is non-normative.</em></p>
<p>When a user is invited to connect to a service, a verifiable trust-compliant user agent performs <em>trust resolution</em> on the service, presents the resulting Proof-of-Trust to the user, and prompts them to either accept or refuse the connection.</p>
<p><img src="./img/proof-of-trust.png" alt="proof-of-trust"></p>
<p>Trust Resolution is as simple as calling a method passing the DID of the service we want to resolve, to display a <strong>Proof-of-Trust</strong> to the end-user:</p>
<pre class="language-json"><code class="language-json">resolve_trust(<span class="token string">"did:example:gaia"</span>)

<p>Let’s explain how the Verifiable Trust does it.</p>
<p><img src="./img/vt-creds-explained.png" alt="Verifiable Service"></p>
<p>The core idea behind Verifiable Trust is simple: trust should not be implicit, but it should be verifiable, transparent, and decentralized.</p>
<p>In this example, a Verifiable Service (VS) presents several Verifiable Credentials to prove:</p>
<ul>
<li>Who operates the service, using an Essential Credential Schema (ECS) Service Verifiable Trust Credential (data shown in red)</li>
<li>What the service offers, using another ECS Service Verifiable Trust Credential (data shown in blue)</li>
<li>Trademark information, using a Trademark Verifiable Trust Credential (data shown in green)</li>
</ul>
<p>Additionally, the Verifiable Service presents computed reputation information (data shown in black). While this reputation data may support trust decisions, it is not directly defined by this specification. Refer to the <a href="https://verana-labs.github.io/verifiable-trust-vpr-spec/">VPR Spec</a> for more information.</p>
<p>Verifiable Trust introduces the following core concepts:</p>
<ul>
<li>Verifiable Service (VS)</li>
<li>Verifiable User Agent (VUA)</li>
<li>Verifiable Public Registry (VPR)</li>
<li>Verifiable Trust Credentials</li>
<li>Essential Credential Schemas (ECS)</li>
</ul>
<p>The Proof-of-Trust is established by recursively resolving the credentials presented by (in this example) a service. What makes this trust verifiable is the use of cryptographic mechanisms built into Decentralized Identifiers (DIDs) and Verifiable Credentials, as applied across these five key concepts.</p>
<p>Because these concepts are deeply interdependent, you may need to explore them together, and revisit them several times to fully grasp the Verifiable Trust model.</p>
<h3 id="what-is-a-verifiable-service-vs"><a class="toc-anchor" href="#what-is-a-verifiable-service-vs">§</a> What is a Verifiable Service (VS)?</h3>
<p><em>This section is non-normative.</em></p>
<p>A Verifiable Service (VS) is a service capable of identifying itself to a peer before any connection is established.</p>
<p>Peers wishing to connect to a VS can review the Verifiable Credentials presented by the service, verify their legitimacy through trust resolution, and decide whether to proceed with the connection based on the outcome.</p>
<p>A VS is also required to verify the trustworthiness of peers attempting to connect to it, whether those peers are other Verifiable Services (VS) or Verifiable User Agents (VUA), and must reject connections from non-verifiable peers.</p>
<p>Furthermore, if a Verifiable Service wants to issue credentials or request credential presentation, it must first prove that it is authorized to perform these actions. Otherwise, the peer must refuse the request.</p>
<h3 id="what-is-a-verifiable-user-agent-vua"><a class="toc-anchor" href="#what-is-a-verifiable-user-agent-vua">§</a> What is a Verifiable User Agent (VUA)?</h3>
<p><em>This section is non-normative.</em></p>
<p>A Verifiable User Agent (VUA) is software, such as a browser, app, or wallet, designed to connect with Verifiable Services (VS) and other VUAs. When establishing connections, a VUA must verify the identity and trustworthiness of its peers and allow connections only to compliant VS or VUA peers.</p>
<p>As part of this process, the VUA must perform trust resolution by:</p>
<ul>
<li>Verifying the Verifiable Credentials presented by the peers</li>
<li>Querying Verifiable Public Registries (VPRs) to confirm that these credentials were issued by recognized and authorized issuers.</li>
</ul>
<p>This ensures that all connections are based on verifiable trust, not assumptions.</p>
<h3 id="what-is-a-verifiable-public-registry-vpr"><a class="toc-anchor" href="#what-is-a-verifiable-public-registry-vpr">§</a> What is a Verifiable Public Registry (VPR)?</h3>
<div id="note-1" class="notice note"><a class="notice-link" href="#note-1">NOTE</a><p>There is a <a href="https://verana-labs.github.io/verifiable-trust-vpr-spec/">separated VPR spec</a>. The following summarizes the main features of a VPR.</p>
</div>
<p><em>This section is non-normative.</em></p>
<p>A <strong>Verifiable Public Registry (VPR)</strong> is a <strong>“registry of registries”</strong>, a public service that provides foundational infrastructure for decentralized trust ecosystems. It offers:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p><strong>Trust Registry Management</strong>:<br>
Ecosystems can create and manage their own <strong>Trust Registries</strong>, each with:</p>
<ul>
<li>Defined <strong>Credential Schemas</strong></li>
<li>Assigned roles for <strong>Issuers</strong>, <strong>Verifiers</strong>, and <strong>Grantors</strong> (Trust Registry Operators)</li>
<li>Custom <strong>business models</strong> and permission policies</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Query API for Trust Resolution</strong>:<br>
A standardized API used by <strong>Verifiable Services (VSs)</strong> and <strong>Verifiable User Agents (VUAs)</strong> to perform trust resolution, enabling them to query registry data and validate roles and permissions in real time. Query API must include support for the <a href="https://trustoverip.github.io/tswg-trust-registry-protocol/">TRQP</a>.</p>

<p>Data stored in a VPR is not verified at the time of storage, nor does it need to be. Verification happens outside the scope of the VPR.</p>
<p>This is not a limitation, it’s a feature. For example, any DID method can be used, and the VPR will never attempt to resolve or validate DIDs itself.</p>
<p>The VPR provides registrations, not validations, leaving trust decisions and verification where they belong: <strong>with the relying parties</strong>.</p>
<p>To make things verifiable, for a given credential schema:</p>
<ul>
<li>Ecosystem creates a Credential Json Schema in a VPR, linked to its Ecosystem DID.</li>
<li>Ecosystem issues, with its DID, a <strong>Json Schema Credential</strong> linked to its credential <strong>Json Schema</strong> in the VPR</li>
<li>Then, authorized issuers can issue <strong>Verifiable Trust Credentials</strong> linked to the <strong>Json Schema Credential</strong> issued by Ecosystem DID.</li>
</ul>

<p>Essential Credential Schemas are the Verifiable Trust basic needed schemas for enabling a minimum trust resolution in Services and User Agents by answering these questions:</p>
<ul>
<li>who is the provider of this Verifiable Service?</li>
<li>what is the minimum age required to access this Verifiable Service?</li>
<li>is the User Agent trying to connect to a Verifiable Service a Verifiable User Agent?</li>
<li>…</li>
</ul>
<p>Ecosystems can create Essential Credential Schemas (ECS) by creating a Trust Registry in a [[ref: VPR]]. There are 4 kinds of ECS:</p>
<ul>
<li>Service;</li>
<li>Organization;</li>
<li>Persona;</li>
<li>UserAgent.</li>
</ul>
<p>An Ecosystem creates its Trust Registry in a [[ref: VPR]] by creating a <code>TrustRegistry</code> entry <code>tr</code>. For this Trust Registry to qualify for being used for trust resolution in [[ref: VSs]] and [[ref: VUAs]], it MUST provide, associated to the <code>TrustRegistry</code> entry <code>tr</code>, at least one <code>CredentialSchema</code> entry, with a respective <code>json_schema</code> attribute defined as follows in [ECS-SERVICE], [ECS-ORG], [ECS-PERSONA], [ECS-UA].</p>

<p>For any <strong>credential issuance</strong> or <strong>credential verification</strong>, in addition to verifying the compliance of their peers ([[ref: VSs]] and [[ref: VUAs]]), entities MUST query the relevant <strong>Verifiable Public Registry (VPR)</strong> to ensure that the credential(s) are being issued or verified by <strong>authorized entities</strong>.</p>
<p>Depending on the permissions registered in the VPR(s), the issuer or verifier MAY be required to execute a transaction in the VPR, which MAY involve the payment of <strong>trust fees</strong>, prior to offering or requesting the presentation of a credential.</p>
<p>The receiving [[ref: VS]] or [[ref: VUA]] MUST deny the credential offer or presentation request if these preconditions are not met.</p>
<p><em>This section is non-normative and should be developed with examples and flow diagrams.</em></p>
<p>When a [[ref: VS]] or a [[ref: VUA]] receives a <strong>credential offer</strong> or a <strong>presentation request</strong>, it must use the appropriate <strong>VPR endpoints</strong> to verify the following:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>Whether the <strong>requesting party is authorized</strong> to perform the action.<br>
Authorization CAN depend on factors such as <strong>jurisdiction</strong> or <strong>assurance level</strong>.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Whether a <strong>payment (trust fee)</strong> is required for the requested operation.<br>
If payment is required:</p>
<ul>
<li>The requesting party must obtain a <strong><code>uuid</code> token</strong> from the requested party.</li>
<li>The requesting party must execute a transaction in the VPR to pay the trust fees, referencing the provided <code>uuid</code>.</li>
<li>The requesting party must notify the requested party that the payment has been completed.</li>
<li>The requested party must verify the payment status by querying the VPR before proceeding.</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<p>The requested [[ref: VS]] or [[ref: VUA]] must reject the credential offer or presentation request if these conditions are not fulfilled.</p>
<p>Please refer to Permission Module in [[ref: VPR]] specs for more information.</p>

<h4 id="hologram-messaging"><a class="toc-anchor" href="#hologram-messaging">§</a> Hologram Messaging</h4>
<p><em>This section is non-normative.</em></p>
<p>Hologram Messaging is a Verifiable Credential wallet and messaging app with true privacy preserving features. Unlike other messaging apps, Hologram is a self-custody app, which means user’s data is only stored on device, and exclusively under user’s control.</p>
<p>Hologram is the first ever-built VUA and is already available in the app stores, look for “Hologram Messaging” in apple store, google play or huawei’s app gallery. It has a user interface very similar to that well known apps like whatsapp, signal or telegram.</p>
<p>Based on the <a href="https://didcomm.org">DIDComm</a> open protocol, Hologram provides classic features such has peer-to-peer chat with verifiable credential exchange (to be able to verify who I am chatting to), as well as a Verifiable Chatbot browser to connect to any decentralized Hologram Chatbot VS. Anyone can create an Hologram Service, publish its DID, and invite users to connect by using Hologram (or any other compatible User Agent), request Verifiable Credential Presentations, issue credentials, perform calls and video calls, exchange content, read NFC chips, and more. Integration of p2p money transfers and payments are underway.</p>
<p>Because Hologram is using the <a href="https://didcomm.org">DIDComm</a> open protocol, anyone can create a new interoperable VUA so that Hologram users will natively be able to chat with users from others compatible VUAs.</p>

<h4 id="hologram-services"><a class="toc-anchor" href="#hologram-services">§</a> Hologram Services</h4>
<p><em>This section is non-normative.</em></p>
<p>Hologram Services can be of 2 kinds:</p>
<ul>
<li>Chatbot Services</li>
<li>Basic Out-of-band Services, for Verifiable Credential Presentation Request and/or Verifiable Credential Issuance.</li>
</ul>
<p>Creation of an Hologram Service is really straightforward, just have a look at <a href="https://github.com/2060-io">2060.io github repository</a> for examples.</p>
<p>Popular Chatbot Services include:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>UnicID, a chatbot service for obtaining a Verifiable Credential by reading a NFC-compatible passport or Id Card with a mobile phone. Service reads the document, then perform a biometric face matching with liveness detection to verify that user of the mobile phone is the same person than the picture of the face registered in the NFC chip of the document, and if there is a match, a Verifiable Credential is issued to user. After issuing the credential, service does not keep any user-related data.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>AvatarID, a service for creating a unique avatar, protected by a biometric hash of user’s face. If user looses his/her phone, he/she can restore the Avatar by performing a biometric face matching with liveness detection.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>Basic Out-of-band Services include:</p>
<ul>
<li>VC Authenticator: an OpenID connect plugin for logging-in a user by requesting presentation of a verifiable credential</li>
<li>VC Verifier: a simple service for generating a Verifiable Credential Presentation Request link so that user present the credential and service instantly receives corresponding data to an URL callback.</li>
</ul>
